# Face Detection Using Python

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for face detection using various techniques and libraries.

## Features

- Detection of human faces in images and video streams.
- Implementation using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.
- Support for different face detection algorithms (e.g., Haar cascades, deep learning models).
- Example scripts and tutorials to get started quickly.

## Usage
- Run the scripts provided to detect faces in images or real-time video.
- Customize parameters and algorithms based on specific requirements.
- Refer to the documentation in each script for more detailed instructions.

## Examples
- image_face_detection.py: Detect faces in a single image.
- video_face_detection.py: Real-time face detection in webcam feed.
- custom_face_detection.py: Implement custom face detection algorithms or configurations.
